This is evident to me becuase when examining the diagram you can see the student adds 10 mg of fertilizer to plant A and not plant B. This is the variable that is evident in this diagram. From what I know it is the only thing changing making the question I selected the most likely. ,2,1983,1,The changes in the population of foxes affects the population of rabbits. If you observe the graph you can notice a trend. When the number of foxes is low the number of rabbits is high. This is caused by the fact that foxes eat rabbits becuase of this when the number of foxes is low the rabbits have less predators consuming the population and letting it flourish. You can see when the foxes are at the peak the number of rabbits come crahsing down becuase of the amout being consumed by foxes. When the number of foxes hit a peak about every 35 years the rabbits dip below the number of foxes and the foxes do not have enough food this causes the fox population to crash and let the rabbit population grow in size untill there is enough for a large amount of foxes and history repeats itself.  ,2,"You have to add 80- 120 mg of fertilizer to get the best results for your rice. In the areas 6,7, and 8 contain the highest rice yeild. If you look at the graph you can see areas 6 and 7 have 26,2 kg of rice yeild and 8 which is less favorable gets 26.1 kg of rice yield. The chart shows as you add more fertilizer to your crop the yield improves. This changes once you hit 120 mg of fertilizer causing a slight down tick. If you look at area 10 this is an example of adding way to much fetilizer. You added 160 mg of fetilizer and got 14.4 kg of rice yield. This number is comparable to 50 mg of fertilizer. Too much fertilizer can damage the plants and cause less favorable numbers. Where as also if you add too little the crops do not get enough damaging the rice yield. ",2,You should set up 1 bird feeder and add sunflower seeds and hang it up on a bird post in your backyard for a week and count every bird that flys into the yard to get sunflower seeds. Another thing you could do if this is not possible is measure how much sunflower seed was consumed by adding the same amount and measuring what is left. When you have gotten your number of birds consuming or the amount consumed you take the bird feeder down and put in thistle seeds. Run the same experiment for a week. You can compare results. Lastly put both sunflower and thistle seeds into the bird feeder and run the same experiment. Gather your results and compare. Find what works the best or attract more birds and hang it up. ,2,"The rising sea temperatures affect some types of coral and algae in the ocean. Gathering information from Barbra¬¥s model you can see that algae A¬¥s survial is being affected by rising ocean temperatures. On the contrary you can see the rising ocean temperatures are not affecting algae B. The rising sea temperature are important becuase of this mutually beneficial relationship between coral and algae.  Coral provides algae with nutrients and algae gives coral sugar. This is essentially like a land lord, you give them money and they give you a roof over your head. When the ocean temperature is affecting the survival rate of algae there is less algae to take nutrients and give sugar. Going to our analogy this is like if no one is living the house. You do not get money and you can not make the house look nice or do anything. This makes the coral struggle beucase it needs sugar and kills the coral or makes it look dead and terrible. ",2,"When the Asian silver carp entered Lake Erie the population of smaller fish decreased. The Asian silver carp does not affect each fish in the same way. The fish called a Shad had a 20 percent decrease when the Asian silver carp entered Lake Erie. When the carp entered the Shinner had a 35 percent decrease on population. On the contrary when the carp entered the Small mouth bass had a 16 percent increase. This is becuase a new food source for the bass entered Lake Erie. Where as with the Shad and the Shinner decreased becuase a new predator entered the lake. The Shad and the Shinner both eat small plants and animals. Where the bass eats small fish, such as the Asian silver carp. This evidence concludes that this fish entering this ecosystem removed a food source for other fish while adding a food source for the bass. This caused a increase of bass and a decrease of smaller fish such as the Shad and Shinner",2,1 jgday73,14,,,,,,,,,,

However, if looked carefully, you can see that the increasing and decreasing of the rabbits and foxes occur at different times. For example, in 1940, this was one of the years that the number of foxes decreased. From this, we can also see that the population of the rabbits were rising, and increasing. So, as the population of the foxes go down, the population of the rabbits go up, and vice versa. I predict this happens because, the less foxes there are, the more chance the rabbits will be able to survive due to the less amount of foxes hunting them. ",1,"From the graph shown above, different amounts of fertilizer affect the amount of rice. For example when there is 0 amount of fertilizer added, there is only 7.1 kg of rice for that area. But as the amount of fertilizer added increases, the number of the yield of rice also goes up. However, after the point of adding 120 units of fertilizer, the yield of rice goes down, instead of going up. The amount of rice stays the same through the numbers 70 to 100 units of fertilizer. Anything larger than that causes the amount of rice to go down. This is because, too much fertilizer will actually not help plants grow, as too much of everything is unhealthy and unbalanced. Therefore, the amount of fertilizer from 70 to 100, is the perfect amount of fertilizer that is needed for the rice to thrive and grow.",2,"An experiment that the bird watcher can conduct to help her decide which food will attract more birds, will require different types of foods. The bird watcher can set bird feeders that hold seeds and fill each with different types of foods. Each bird feeder will contain only one type of food. The different foods will be the only aspect that is changed in this experiment. Then, she could set the feeders in the same location, each, spaced apart equally. To make sure that the same birds come to the feeders, she will set them up and test them all in the same day. The bird watcher will then, go inside and look at her bird feeders through her window. She will need a timer also. With the timer she will measure 10 minutes, and in that time span she will record how many birds went to each bird feeder.

In Barbara's model, she shows us two different interactions between the two different corals. They both have feeding interactions with Algae, and the same interactions. The only different interaction that sets these two corals apart is the other interaction Coral A has with the ocean. The rising ocean temperatures affect the survival of Algae A. Since Algae and Corals have a mutually beneficial relationship, if one is affected, then the other, like a cause and effect will also be affected. Since in this case, the Algae of Coral A is affected, that also affects the survival of the coral since it depends on each other. Algae is a healthy plant like organism that benefits the ocean and the corals, as it gives it color. However due to the rising temperatures of the ocean, the algae can die, which can also affect the survival of the corals.",2,"The Asian silver carp will affect all the fish that live in Lake Erie. This is because, the food sources that the Asian silver carp will take can affect other fish. The Asian silver carp eats small plants and animals, and they share the same food as some other fish such as the Shad and Shiner fish. In the table shown above, it shows that the fish who share the same food source as the Asian silver carp has decreased in population. The Shiner fish has decreased by 20% while the Shad fish has decreased by 35%. However the small mouth bass has increased by 16% because they feed on the Asian silver carp, which they do not share the same food source.

Because of this, the corals aren't able to survive which was why the coral reefs weren't alive, and instead were dead and white.",2,"  The Asian silver carp does not affect each fish in the same way. Some started increasing, while others decreased. However this reaction was for different reasons. 
  For the Shad and Shiner, they decreased because their food source was being eliminated. Because their food source is the same as the Asian silver carp, they do not have enough food for themselves to survive, so they are dying. However, for the Small mouth bass, their food source is Asian silver carp. Because of the increase in silver carp, the bass have a larger food supply, so they are increasing. 
  The Asian silver carp is impacting all of these plants and animals. For some of them the silver carp are taking away the food supply, causing a population decrease. However, for another type of fish the silver carp is the food supply, so they are positively impacting the population.

This also applies to the question of ""does the sun affect how tall the plants grow"".

Because we have already chosen the required amount, we don't need to ask this question. Finally it is time to rule out the final question, ""how much fertilizer do flowering plants need"", we can rule out this question because the text and diagram don't provide us with the evidence to ask this question. The diagram shows plant A receiving fertilizer unlike plant B, the diagram does not provide two doses of differing size, which would make sense to me if you were trying to answer a question like this one.

",2,1985,1,"We know from the text that the fox doesn't have any predators, the text doesn't say that this applies to the rabbits. By cross referencing the two animals in the decades we can see that, in the 1920's the fox population and the rabbit population declined together. We see it again in the 1960's and the 1990's. When we compare these population drought years to population growth years, like the 1940's and 1980's we can come to the conclusion that the foxes and rabbits directly affect each other, like the fox being the rabbits predator. This is known because when the rabbit population increases, the fox population increases and when the rabbit population declines, the fox population declines too. It is also seen when the fox population increases the rabbit population decreases, leading me to believe that the fox hunts the rabbits and when the foxes have eaten the majority of the rabbit population, the fox population decline, as shown on the graph.",2,"The over usage of fertilizer can lead to decreased performance.

Areas 8,9 and 10 all have fertilizer dosages of 100+ units of nitrogen per area. When we look at areas 5,6 and 7 they all have dosages under or equal to 100 units of nitrogen per area.

The measurement system would be a camera running during the allotted time.
The data collection points would be the frequency of bird stops during the time between 6 am and 7 pm, the frequency of emptiness of the seed stock, the duration spent by birds feeding on the seeds and the variety of birds eating from the supplied seed. ",1,"The relation between coral and algae is a mutually beneficial relationship. Coral provided algae with nutrients and algae provides necessary sugar for the coral so it can continue producing the nutrients and sustain itself. But when the ocean temperature increases it affects the survivability of the algae and it causes the algae to lose the ability to sustain itself, directly affecting the coral, which without it's crucial sugar cannot survive. ",1,"The exposing of the invasive Asian silver carp has affected the native species of Lake Erie in different ways. 

When referred to the current table with the listed species Shad, Shiner and Smallmouth bass the population of the Shad decreased by 20% when the Asian silver carp was exposed. The Shiner population decreased by 35%  and the Smallmouth bass population increased by 16% when the Asian silver carp invaded Lake Erie. The Shad and the Shiner both eat small plants and animals, unlike the Smallmouth bass which eats Asian silver carp and minnows. With the data from the table it can be understood that the Smallmouth gained another food source, which was the Asian silver carp. This led to the Smallmouths 16% percent population increase due to the abundance in food. With review of the top text and the data table, it can be observed that Shad, Shiner and the Asian silver carp all share the same type of food source. Small plants and animals. This is the cause of the decrease in Shad and Shiner population, due to the exposing of the carp to Lake Erie the sources of food for each fish has decreased.

The effects that the Asian silver carp created is felt differently for each fish. In this case the Shad and Shiner population has decreased because the Asian silver carp also shares the same food source as them in contrast the Smallmouth population has increased because the addition of the Asian silver carp as another food source. This shows that when an invasive species is exposed to an environment it can affect the inhabitants in many ways, some similar, some different.  ",2,1 rbday72,12,,,,,,,,,,

Although we do not know what we are measuring, we can predict that this question is the best option for this experiment because it includes the thing we are measuring; height.

This is because, in 1948, the year the rabbits' population was increased to its highest, the population of the Foxes were in its decreased population. This affected the population of the rabbits because the more or less foxes there are, there are less or more rabbits. Every so 50 years, the populations of the rabbits and foxes increase and decrease to its highest or lowest. Although the populations of these animals are not stable, they go up and down in a cycle, showing us that their populations completely depend on each other. Another thing is, the populations of the rabbits and foxes are a chain to each other. For example, in the year 1930, the population of the rabbits decreased. 10 years later, the population of the foxes decreased also because of the lack of food it got from having so little rabbits. During this time of the decreased foxes however, the rabbits were increasing in number. And again, in 1950, when the numbers of the rabbits spiked up, the numbers of the foxes also increased due to the increase of the rabbits.

Like other corals, coral A can easily die off if something is wrong with the survival of the algae. Due to global warming and climate change, the temperatures of the ocean are rising.

The water temperature affects the survival of some algae whom are crucial to some corals survival by providing the coral with sugar. The rising water temperature could cause those types of algae to die causing the corals that rely on those algae to be unhealthy. Other corals would be healthy because those corals either don't rely on algae that dies because of water temperature or they live in areas where the water temperature is fine and doesn't kill the algae. ,2,The Asian silver carp will not affect all the fish in Lake Erie in the same way. Evidence in the data table shows that after the Asian silver carp came into Lake Erie the population of Shad and Shiner decreased while the population of the Smallmouth Bass increased. This is because the Asian silver carp eats small plants and animals and the Shad and Shiner also eats the same thing so when the Asian silver carp got into Lake Erie there was less food for the Shad and Shiner decreased causing their population to decrease. The Smallmouth Bass population increased because they don't eat the same thing as the Asian silver carp and instead eat small fish so that wouldn't make their population decrease.

However after the yields of rice peaked at 70-100 units of nitrogen per area of fertilizer, the yield started to go down again.

The next month she should clean out the bird house, fill it with thistle seeds, and hang it in the exact same spot. She should again check on it each hour until it is empty and record the time and amount of birds. Then she should see how many birds it took in the time to eat all the seeds. If there were a lot of birds but it took a really long time, and the other took shorter time, the second one would have attracted more birds in that time.",2,"As we can see in the model, Coral B does not have the rising ocean temperature. Because of this their balance of algae providing sugar to coral and coral providing nutrients to algae stays stable. When we put in the rising temperatures this balance is thrown off, causing the coral reefs to die. As we can see the rising temperature negatively impacts the Algae A, which means it can no longer provide sugar to the Coral. Without the sugar the coral cannot provide nutrients to the algae which kills it, killing the Coral in the process. Because of this the coral reefs cannot survive and so they look discolored and dead. ",2,"  The Asian silver carp do not affect each fish in the same way. For the shad and shiner the Asian silver carp is causing a decrease by taking away their food source. However for smallmouth bass Asian silver carp are increasing their population as they are acting as a new food source. 

  In the table we can see that both the shad and shiner had their populations decrease. We also know that that shads, shiners and Asian silver carps have the same food source. Because of this even though it isn't direct, Asian silver carp are affecting their population. Because their food source is being taken away, they aren't reproducing as much and they are also dying. 
  However, in the table we can also see that the smallmouth bass population was increasing. As shown, the Asian silver carp is the prime food source for the smallmouth bass. Becuase of this, when there was an influx of the Asian silver carp, the smallmouth bass were able to eat a larger amount of food which allowed them to reproduce more and quicker. 

  Asian silver carp shares relationships with all three of these fish in numerous ways. All these relationships share a common factor which is the food chain and ecosystem. The carp eats the shad and shiner food causing them to die, but when the carp is eating by the bass, it gives a chance for the shad and shiner to repopulate. This balanced cycle can and should continue on, keeping the balanced relationship of the ecosystem.

The thing that is being changed is 10 ml of fertilizer in one plant and none in the other. Everything else in this experiment is controlled such as the water, 200 ml was added to each and the type of plant. So therefore the results you compare will show you the difference of the plant between with fertilizer and without.",2,1984,1,The changes in population size of rabbits and foxes are related because whenever there are more rabbits there are less foxes or whenever there are more foxes there are less rabbits. This is because the foxes have no predators so they are the top predators in the ecosystem. The foxes hunt the rabbits decreasing their population and increasing theirs because they have a lot of food. Then the population of the foxes grows too big and some of them starve and there are not as many foxes which means more rabbits and the pattern keeps repeating.,2,"You have to use the correct amount of fertilizer on the plant to achieve the best results. I said this because according to the table the yield of rice in kg was the most near the middle of the table when they added a suitable amount of fertilizer, not too much not too little.

In the middle when they added a good amount of fertilizer such as 70 80 and 100 they achieved 26.2 kg of ricer. Whereas in the end when they added too much fertilizer 140 and 160 we can see they only achieved 17.6 and 14.4 kg of rice.

These are the things I will keep the same every time. Next I will watch and collect what birds eat first, finish first and how much of every food was eaten. This way I can create a list of which seeds are most popular because they will be the seeds finished first or eaten more of.",2,Some of the corals appear colorful and healthy well others appear white and dead because rising ocean temperatures are affecting algae A. Some people might think this makes no sense the Ocean is only affecting the algae not the coral. This is not true because organisms in an ecosystem are all connected they are dependent on each other to survive. For example the model shows that the coral pairs with algae A and gives it nutrients which it then turns in sugar for the coral to use. Without each other the organisms could not survive because they are dependent on each other.That is why some of the coral are white and dead because they algae they are dependent on is dying off; they have no source of sugar.,2,"Asian Silver Carp will not affect all this fish in the same way because it will be food for some fish and take food from others causing some populations to increase and others to decrease. For example, Asian Silver Carp caused Shad and Shiner to decrease in population, Shad decreased by 20% and Shiner decreased by 35%. This makes sense because Asian Silver Carp eats small plants and animals, Shad and Shiner also eat small plants and animals. With more competition for food and less food to go around some fish will starve causing populations to decrease. On the other hand Asian Silver Carp will also cause populations to increase because they provide a source of food to predators such as the Small mouth bass. They had a 16 % increase. This makes sense because Asian Silver Carp provided more food for them to eat therefore increasing their population.

However, because the smallmouth bass preys on Asian silver carp, their population will increase because they will suddenly have a new and plentiful supply of prey and they eat.

They are also adding 10 mL of fertilizer to one plant, and not the other (that I can see). That is why I think that the question is if fertilizer added to the soil leads to taller flowering plants.",2,1994,0,"When the population of rabbits rises, so does the population of foxes. They rise and fall at around the same rate, but the fox population line is a little bit behind the rabbit population line. We can see that the fox population rises when the rabbit population is almost at its lowest, and that the fox population is at its lowest when the rabbit population is just beginning to rise again.",0,"If you want to grow the maximum rice, you should use 70-120 units of fertilizer. In the chart, we can see that the amount of rice harvested peaks right in areas 5,6,7, and 8. These areas yielded 26.1-26.2 kg of rice, while the difference of the others was quite noticeable. 60 units of fertilizer will work as well, but we can see that the area (4) with only 60 units of fertilizer yields 25.4 kg of rice, almost a full kg behind areas 6,7, and 8.",1,"Set up different feeders, each with one kind of food or seed in them. Measure the same amount of each food into each feeder, and record it. At the end of the day, record the amount of food in each, then refill them. If done consistently for a few days, the record should be able to show which food is more popular for the birds. For example, if, at the end of each day, there is less thistle seed in that specific seeder for more than a few days straight, you can infer that the thistle seed is more popular among the birds than the other foods.",2,"The rise of temperature in the ocean affects Algae A because the warmer temperature can stress or cause other problems in the algae. When the algae provides sugar to Coral A, it could provide less sugar because of the stress. This means that Coral A wouldn't be able to provide as many nutrients for Algae A, and as the cycle continues, both the algae and the coral would provide less and less sugar and nutrients to each other. Eventually, both the algae and coral would die because of lack of nutrients/sugar. Thus does not happen with Algae and Coral B, because the ocean temperature is not stressing the algae, which means that the algae and coral can provide each other with the things they need, and this process will not be disrupted.",2,"The Asian silver carp will not affect each type of fish in the same way. In the chart, we can see that the Shad and Shiner population is decreasing, and their food source is small plants and animals. We also know that the Asian silver carp eats the small plants and animals, which then we can infer that the rise in Asian silver carp is causing the carp to eat from the Shad and Shiner's food supply. However, since the Asian silver carp has been introduced, the Smallmouth bass now has more food. This means that the bass can eat more food, which explains the increase in population. Asian silver carp aren't taking away from the bass food supply, and the bass have no hunter (that we can see), therefore they can thrive with a plentiful food supply. Smallmouth bass are at the top of the food process here, as they eat the other small fish and have no hunter. The small fish - Asian silver carp  and minnows - eat small plants and animals, but since the Asian silver carp are eating from the Shad and Shiner food supply, that means that the Shad and Shiner have less food, causing their population to decrease.

One reason the shiner and shad's are decreasing could be because they have the same diet as a Asian silver carp, this would make them eat the same food and with more fish the demand for food would be greater and they would die.

In the table it can be observed, it's all about finding the sweet spot. Take example areas 4, 6 and 8. Area 4 has 60 units of nitrogen in its area, this creates a yield of 25.4 kg of rice. Now area 5 here there are 80 units of nitrogen creating a yield of 26.2 kg of rice. Finally area 8 with 120 units of nitrogen and 26.1 kg of rice to be yielded. Now the productiveness of the nitrogen stops at 80 units of nitrogen, but it is still a better yield than area 4 and 8. The amount used in  area 4 doesn't quite get full productiveness when looking at area 5 it is seen that its 70 units of nitrogen creates a 26.2 yield of rice, most bang for your buck. With area 8 though it is shown that the 120 units of nitrogen start to become detrimental decreasing the yield.
