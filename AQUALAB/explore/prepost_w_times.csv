If the amount of rabbits gets too small because of foxes eating them the population of foxes will go down because they have less food. When the population of foxes goes down the population of rabbits can go back up because there are less predators to eat them. That would just restart the whole process.,Fertilizer does increase the yield of rice to an extent. In the table it shows that the fertilizer does increase the yield of rice however it stops increasing at about 70 actually goes down when you put too much fertilizer at about 140. ,The bird watcher could do this experiment over 3 weeks in spring or summer where birds come out more. Each day in the 3 weeks she could put and different type of bird seed in a bird feeder and set up a camera to record if any birds came. After the day ends she could take the recording and count how many birds that type of seed attracted. She could repeat that process over 3 weeks with every type of seed and use all of that data to find which seed attracted the most birds over that time span.,Some corals appear colorful and are healthy while other corals appear white and dead because of the water temperature. The water temperature affects the survival of some algae whom are crucial to some corals survival by providing the coral with sugar. The rising water temperature could cause those types of algae to die causing the corals that rely on those algae to be unhealthy. Other corals would be healthy because those corals either don't rely on algae that dies because of water temperature or they live in areas where the water temperature is fine and doesn't kill the algae. ,The Asian silver carp will not affect all the fish in Lake Erie in the same way. Evidence in the data table shows that after the Asian silver carp came into Lake Erie the population of Shad and Shiner decreased while the population of the Smallmouth Bass increased. This is because the Asian silver carp eats small plants and animals and the Shad and Shiner also eats the same thing so when the Asian silver carp got into Lake Erie there was less food for the Shad and Shiner decreased causing their population to decrease. The Smallmouth Bass population increased because they don't eat the same thing as the Asian silver carp and instead eat small fish so that wouldn't make their population decrease. It increased instead because they now have a new food source in the Asian silver carp.,Neither agree nor disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat disagree,Somewhat disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat disagree,I liked that it had a storyline along with the actual learning part keeping kids slightly more engaged.,I feel like Wake could make the explanations about how things happen more clearly.,"It helped me learn how modeling relationships in an ecosystem works, and how to collect and use data in order to learn more about an ecosystem."

","70-100 units of nitrogen per area of fertilizer creates a larger yield of rice.I know this looking at the different amount of fertilizer compared to rice.

The next month she should clean out the bird house, fill it with thistle seeds, and hang it in the exact same spot. She should again check on it each hour until it is empty and record the time and amount of birds. Then she should see how many birds it took in the time to eat all the seeds. If there were a lot of birds but it took a really long time, and the other took shorter time, the second one would have attracted more birds in that time.","As we can see in the model, Coral B does not have the rising ocean temperature. Because of this their balance of algae providing sugar to coral and coral providing nutrients to algae stays stable. When we put in the rising temperatures this balance is thrown off, causing the coral reefs to die. As we can see the rising temperature negatively impacts the Algae A, which means it can no longer provide sugar to the Coral. Without the sugar the coral cannot provide nutrients to the algae which kills it, killing the Coral in the process. Because of this the coral reefs cannot survive and so they look discolored and dead. ","  The Asian silver carp do not affect each fish in the same way. For the shad and shiner the Asian silver carp is causing a decrease by taking away their food source. However for smallmouth bass Asian silver carp are increasing their population as they are acting as a new food source. 

  In the table we can see that both the shad and shiner had their populations decrease. We also know that that shads, shiners and Asian silver carps have the same food source. Because of this even though it isn't direct, Asian silver carp are affecting their population. Because their food source is being taken away, they aren't reproducing as much and they are also dying. 
  However, in the table we can also see that the smallmouth bass population was increasing. As shown, the Asian silver carp is the prime food source for the smallmouth bass. Becuase of this, when there was an influx of the Asian silver carp, the smallmouth bass were able to eat a larger amount of food which allowed them to reproduce more and quicker. 

  Asian silver carp shares relationships with all three of these fish in numerous ways. All these relationships share a common factor which is the food chain and ecosystem. The carp eats the shad and shiner food causing them to die, but when the carp is eating by the bass, it gives a chance for the shad and shiner to repopulate. This balanced cycle can and should continue on, keeping the balanced relationship of the ecosystem.

This means that since the ocean temperatures are affecting the algae, the algae can no longer provide for the coral causing it to die and look dead.

Meanwhile, the Smallmouth bass has increased in population due to the fact that it eats Asian silver carp and minnows.

Another thing that was challenging were the jobs. They were confusing at sometimes and Vict0r wasn't helping. For example I tried to figure out the eating rates in the measurement tank. I couldn't figure out which varibles to click and when I did it was incorrect or said that the experiment was inconclusive. I asked Vict0r what to do and all it said was to check the AQOS, so I did and it just said to figure out what the eating rate of the species was. I eventually just had to skip that job because I wasn't told what to do. The shrimp-tastrophe job was absolutely impossible to finish.

This means that the scientist is trying to find the difference between a plant with no additional fertilizer or a plant with added fertilizer. ,1984,"The foxes are the predators of the rabbit. The rabbits are the producers while the foxes are the consumers. In the graph when the fox population size is low, the rabbit population size increases greatly. The population size of the rabbits grows into the four hundreds. This is because when the fox population size is low then there are less predators in the area. This means that the rabbits can reproduce easier due to the high chance of survival. When the fox population decreases the rabbit population increases. The graph also shows when the fox population increases the rabbit population decreases.","Too much fertilizer is bad for the yields of rice. The amount of fertilizer that is considered unhealthy and not beneficial for the yields of rice is 120,140, and 160 units of nitrogen per area. Too little fertilizer is also not beneficial for the yields of rice. Too little fertilizer is considered to be 0,30,50, and 60 units of nitrogen per area. In the table it shows that the highest amount of yields of rice per area was 26.2. The yields of rice reached that number in areas 5,6 and 7.

Just after the population of rabbits spikes the fox population spikes as well. This has to do with the fact that the rabbits are the prey of the foxes. When there are so many rabbits the foxes have more than enough food and are more healthy. When the fox population starts to grow from all of the food then the rabbit population drops because they're being eaten by the new amount of foxes. After the rabbit population drops the fox population drops as well from the lack of food. This cycle keeps on repeating about every 30 years.,If between 70 and 100 units of nitrogen per area of fertilizer is added to the rice crops then there will be more kg of rice per area then if an amount of fertilizer outside of that range is added.

And vice versa, when there is a higher population of rabbits, there is likely to be a lower population of foxes. Since when there is a low amount of foxes, less rabbits are eaten and hence there is more foxes. ","We are clearly looking for more rice per area, since we want more rice. Looking at our table, we can see that the amount of rice per area maxes out at section numbered 5,6 and  7. Again taking in the fact that we want to use as little as fertilizer as possible. This is true because saving on resources is good for the environment. Now out of sections 5,6, and 7, number 5 has the least amount of fertilizer being added. So we would like this as the optimal amount. As the other sections go on, (8,9,10), they start to lost rice per area. So then we do not want to use that much fertilizer. We can conclude that the optimal value is the fifth section. As this uses the least amount of fertilizer, and this gains one of the highest kg of rice per area. Number six and seven are also good, but number five uses less fertilizer. ","So we are investigating whether birds enjoy sunflower seeds or thistle seeds more. To conduct an experiment, we can include thistle and sunflower seeds to be in our experiment, at the same time.

To make sure that it is fair, we will take the same amount of thistle and sunflower seeds, and put them in a bowl next to each other. This experiment will actually not have a time limit. We can use a tracker to count and see how many birds appear, and what they eat. We will have a counter for each type of seed.

When the rabbit population is high the foxes have a lot of food letting there population flourish. The foxes eat a lot of rabbits letting the foxes population go high and the rabbit population falls.

",The best amount of fertilizer to use is 70-100 units per area. From our data we can observe that after this amount the soil becomes over fertilized and damaged.

Every so 50 years, the populations of the rabbits and foxes increase and decrease to its highest or lowest. Although the populations of these animals are not stable, they go up and down in a cycle, showing us that their populations completely depend on each other. Another thing is, the populations of the rabbits and foxes are a chain to each other. For example, in the year 1930, the population of the rabbits decreased. 10 years later, the population of the foxes decreased also because of the lack of food it got from having so little rabbits. During this time of the decreased foxes however, the rabbits were increasing in number. And again, in 1950, when the numbers of the rabbits spiked up, the numbers of the foxes also increased due to the increase of the rabbits. Therefore, every 10 or 5 years, the rabbits and the foxes populations are chain reactions of each other, as they impact each others populations.",,,"In this model, the two corals both have the same sugar provider, algae.

However, other interactions of algae A affect the survival of the algae, as the rising temperatures could kill this algae off. Like other corals, coral A can easily die off if something is wrong with the survival of the algae. Due to global warming and climate change, the temperatures of the ocean are rising.

This is because the foxes have no predators so they are the top predators in the ecosystem.

Then the population of the foxes grows too big and some of them starve and there are not as many foxes which means more rabbits and the pattern keeps repeating.,"You have to use the correct amount of fertilizer on the plant to achieve the best results.

Some people might think this makes no sense the Ocean is only affecting the algae not the coral. This is not true because organisms in an ecosystem are all connected they are dependent on each other to survive. For example the model shows that the coral pairs with algae A and gives it nutrients which it then turns in sugar for the coral to use. Without each other the organisms could not survive because they are dependent on each other.That is why some of the coral are white and dead because they algae they are dependent on is dying off; they have no source of sugar.,"Asian Silver Carp will not affect all this fish in the same way because it will be food for some fish and take food from others causing some populations to increase and others to decrease. For example, Asian Silver Carp caused Shad and Shiner to decrease in population, Shad decreased by 20% and Shiner decreased by 35%. This makes sense because Asian Silver Carp eats small plants and animals, Shad and Shiner also eat small plants and animals. With more competition for food and less food to go around some fish will starve causing populations to decrease. On the other hand Asian Silver Carp will also cause populations to increase because they provide a source of food to predators such as the Small mouth bass. They had a 16 % increase.

However, Algae A also provides sugar to coral A which in turn gives the algae nutrients. Because Algae A is struggling to survive, Algae can provide less sugar to the coral which leads to coral providing algae with less nutrients. Does cycle will continue to repeat and eventually lead to Coral A becoming white and dead. However, Coral B is unaffected by the ocean and thus continues to have a stable cycle.","Asian silver carp will not affect all the fish in the same way as the shad and the shiner have seen a decrease while the smallmouth bass have seen an increase. This is because the shad, shiner, and Asian silver carp all prey on small plants and animals. Because the shad and shiner have new competition for the same food, their population will decrease as they will not have the same plentiful food supply they had before. However, because the smallmouth bass preys on Asian silver carp, their population will increase because they will suddenly have a new and plentiful supply of prey and they eat.

She could lay out two piles of seeds side by side but separate for one day and at the end, she could see how many is left of each.","Some corals are vibrant and healthy because the temperatures are lower there.

The white coral may not have algae to make them pretty and happy, and if they don't have any algae to give nutrients to, the coral just doesn't get sugar, either.","The Asian silver carp will not affect all the different fish populations in Lake Erie in the same way. The shad's population has decreased by 20% and its prey includes small plants and animals, so a possibility is that the carp also eats the same prey, therefore competing with each other, or the carp just directly eats the shad. It could be an indirect or direct connection. The shiner's population also decreased - by 35% - and its prey is the same thing as the shad's. Again, it could be that the silver carp eats the same prey and is eating more than the shad and shiner, or the silver carp simply eats the shad and shiner.

In the chart, we can see that the amount of rice harvested peaks right in areas 5,6,7, and 8. These areas yielded 26.1-26.2 kg of rice, while the difference of the others was quite noticeable. 60 units of fertilizer will work as well, but we can see that the area (4) with only 60 units of fertilizer yields 25.4 kg of rice, almost a full kg behind areas 6,7, and 8.","Set up different feeders, each with one kind of food or seed in them. Measure the same amount of each food into each feeder, and record it. At the end of the day, record the amount of food in each, then refill them. If done consistently for a few days, the record should be able to show which food is more popular for the birds. For example, if, at the end of each day, there is less thistle seed in that specific seeder for more than a few days straight, you can infer that the thistle seed is more popular among the birds than the other foods.","The rise of temperature in the ocean affects Algae A because the warmer temperature can stress or cause other problems in the algae. When the algae provides sugar to Coral A, it could provide less sugar because of the stress. This means that Coral A wouldn't be able to provide as many nutrients for Algae A, and as the cycle continues, both the algae and the coral would provide less and less sugar and nutrients to each other. Eventually, both the algae and coral would die because of lack of nutrients/sugar. Thus does not happen with Algae and Coral B, because the ocean temperature is not stressing the algae, which means that the algae and coral can provide each other with the things they need, and this process will not be disrupted.","The Asian silver carp will not affect each type of fish in the same way. In the chart, we can see that the Shad and Shiner population is decreasing, and their food source is small plants and animals. We also know that the Asian silver carp eats the small plants and animals, which then we can infer that the rise in Asian silver carp is causing the carp to eat from the Shad and Shiner's food supply. However, since the Asian silver carp has been introduced, the Smallmouth bass now has more food. This means that the bass can eat more food, which explains the increase in population. Asian silver carp aren't taking away from the bass food supply, and the bass have no hunter (that we can see), therefore they can thrive with a plentiful food supply. Smallmouth bass are at the top of the food process here, as they eat the other small fish and have no hunter. The small fish - Asian silver carp  and minnows - eat small plants and animals, but since the Asian silver carp are eating from the Shad and Shiner food supply, that means that the Shad and Shiner have less food, causing their population to decrease.

When they are decreased, the Asian silver carp could be eating the small plants and animals that the Shad and Shiner eat, but are increasing the smallmouth bass because they might get eaten by the small mouse bath.",Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat disagree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,I liked all the different experiments that I could do.,"I didn't like how hard some jobs were, I would have liked it if Victor had multiple types of hints you could choose, from small to big so that if I was stuck Victor could walk me through it.",I think Wake taught me about experimenting.

Then the experiment would run for 7 days for each type of food and I would count the total number of birds each feeder attracted in 7 days.,"Coral needs algae to give them sugar and in exchange, the coral gives the algae nutrients. The rising ocean temperatures are killing the algae, therefore removing the coral's source of sugar.","The arrival of Asian silver fish will affect shad and shiner fish negatively but will increase the bass population. According to the table, shad population decreased by 20%, shiner decreased by 35%, and bass increased by 16%. The shad and shiner have the same food source as the Asian silver fish so their population will decrease because of more competition for food. The bass eat the silver fish, so therefore the bass will have more food to eat.",Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat disagree,Somewhat disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,It was pretty well designed and the graphics and game-play were good. ,The tasks got a little bit repetitive after a while.,It got me more interested in learning science.

They all yield 26.2 kg, whereas if you add more or less it yields less.","I would put 2 different identical bird feeders in a row, and would watch them at the same time of day each day. I would make sure that they had the same amount of seeds in them, and that they were at the same height. I would measure how many times a bird went to each bird feeder. I would also measure how many seeds were gone at the end of the day. Then after one week of counting how many birds go to each bird feeder, I will look at the data and determine which one attracts more birds.","Because there isn't as much algae A, the coral can't get the sugar it needs, so it starts dying and can't give as much nutrients to the algae, so that dies further. The rising ocean temperatures affect more than just the algae. However, because algae B isn't affected by the rising ocean temperatures, the coral does better.
","Asian silver carp does not affect all fish the same way. By taking the shad and shiners food source, they decrease their population. By giving the smallmouth bass another food source, they increase their population. That is why they do not affect them all the same.",Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree nor disagree,I liked how you got to explore the different ecosystems and solve puzzles.,How repetitive it was.,It helped me see connections between animals.
