## GitHub Codespaces

To learn more about Codespaces, see the GitHub docs here: [Github Codespaces Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).  
If you would like to work on a Codespace locally, rather than in the web-based IDE, see information on local Codespace development in
[VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code) or
[JetBrains](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-in-your-jetbrains-ide).
