# opengamedata-samples

A repository for Jupyter Notebook template files, for use with GitHub Codespaces.

To learn more about Codespaces, see the GitHub docs here: [Github Codespaces Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).  
If you would like to work on a Codespace locally, rather than in the web-based IDE, see information on local Codespace development in
[VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code) or
[JetBrains](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-in-your-jetbrains-ide).

## Creating a new project

- First, create a new Codespace.  
  GitHub will open the VS Code web IDE.
- Navigate to the folder of the game whose data you want to analyze.
- Create a new subfolder for your project.
- Browse the `templates` or `explore` subfolders to find a notebook you wish to use as a starting point.
- Copy the notebook to your project folder, assigning it whatever name you like.
- Commit the new copy with Git.  
    TODO: Fill in details, including setup of branch/fork/whatever
- Perform whatever work you wish on your project.
- If you wish to contribute your work back to the main repository, commit your project folder's changes, and submit a pull request.
