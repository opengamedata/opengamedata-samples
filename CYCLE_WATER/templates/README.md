# Water Templates

Templates for the game _Water Cycle_.  
These templates serve as bare-bones starting points for analysis.
They include sections with boilerplate code for loading, filtering, visualizing, analyzing, and modeling gameplay data.
You can easily substitute column names, visualization function calls, or statistical operations to customize the file to your needs, as well as copying/adding your own analysis code.

- `Water_template_events`: Template for loading and analyzing an event file.
- `Water_template_sessions`: Template for loading and analyzing a per-session feature file.
- `Water_template_players`: Template for loading and analyzing a per-player feature file.
