# Carbon Exploration

## Contents

Basic **Data Exploration** notebooks for the game _Carbon Cycle_.  
These notebooks include a variety of visualizations and statistical summaries to help you explore and understand raw event and feature data files.
The analyses given here are tailored to the specific details of _Carbon Cycle_ gameplay, but include little-to-no data cleaning.  

## Use

We recommend using these files to help you explore and understand key aspects of any new data file you wish to work with in your own analysis.

When the time comes to perform your analysis, we recommend starting with an appropriate file from the `CYCLE_CARBON/templates` folder.
Use the `CYCLE_CARBON/explore` files as inspiration for your work, or copy whole cells into your template-based file.

This folder contains (or will contain) the following:

- `Carbon_explore_events`: Notebook for loading and exploring an event file.
- `Carbon_explore_sessions`: Notebook for loading and exploring a per-session feature file.
- `Carbon_explore_players`: Notebook for loading and exploring a per-player feature file.
- `Carbon_explore_populations`: Notebook for loading and exploring a population feature file.
